### Description

Play Draw Poker. Built on a base by noi_max, heavily modified in all operational aspects. This update puts in a pre-dealer which selects 10 cards and uses them to deal no matter when you hit Deal the second time. I had a totally random dealer which would deal different cards depending on when you hit deal. Look for how you can preview the second 5 cards (pronounced cheat).
 
### More Info
 
This card game has source cards included. No DLL needed.
